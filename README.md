# 🪐 Programming Fundamentals in C++

Welcome to my code repository! This is where I document my step-by-step journey of learning how to program from scratch. Before this summer, I didn't know how programming languages worked. I chose C++ because it is a core part of my college curriculum, and I am loving it now.

Instead of just looking at folders alphabetically, this README maps out my code files in the **exact chronological sequence of concepts** I learned as I progressed from a complete beginner to building a real application.

## 🗺️ My Learning Progression Map

### 🛑 Step 1: The Absolute Beginning (First Lines of Code)
Every programmer starts here. These files taught me the skeleton of a C++ program, the `main()` function, and how to use basic terminal wrappers.
*   `Practice/Basic cout practice/my first.cpp` — The historic first file where I compiled my very first stream.
*   `Practice/Basic cout practice/hello world.cpp` — Getting comfortable printing simple sentences to the terminal window.

### 📺 Step 2: Mastering Console Output (`cout`)
Once I knew how to print a line, I practiced text formatting, spacing, and using escape sequences (`endl`) to present neat information blocks.
*   `Practice/Basic cout practice/about PAK.cpp` — Formatting structured text layout paragraphs describing my country.
*   `Practice/Basic cout practice/about earth.cpp` — Managing screen spacing using clean text streams.
*   `Practice/Basic cout practice/about solar system.cpp` — Grinding long layout strings to learn console presentation.

### 📦 Step 3: Working with Memory (Variables & Data Types)
Here, I moved away from flat sentences and learned how a computer actually reserves memory blocks to store and categorize different types of data.
*   `Practice/variables/integers.cpp` — Working with whole numbers (`int`).
*   `Practice/variables/float.cpp` & `double.cpp` — Handling small and high-precision decimal numbers.
*   `Practice/variables/char.cpp` — Storing single keyboard symbols and characters.
*   `Practice/variables/string.cpp` — Manipulating full lines of dynamic text.
*   `Practice/variables/boolean.cpp` — Using true/false flags (`bool`) for conditional logic.

### ➕ Step 4: Computer Math (Arithmetic Operations)
With variables mastered, I learned how to use arithmetic operators to make the computer perform lightning-fast calculations.
*   `Practice/operations/addition.cpp` & `additions.cpp` — Combining values using sums.
*   `Practice/operations/subtraction.cpp` & `subtractions` — Managing differences between variables.
*   `Practice/operations/multiply.cpp` — Calculating multiplication products.
*   `Practice/operations/divide.cpp` — Handling division and tracking fractional remainders.
*   `Practice/operations/math.cpp` — Combining multiple operators inside unified mathematical expressions.

### 📥 Step 5: Interactive Inputs (`cin`)
This was a massive milestone! I stopped hardcoding data and learned how to make the program pause, ask a human a question, and read live input from the keyboard.
*   `Practice/Basic cin practice/cin practice.cpp` — Capturing dynamic user responses straight from the terminal.
*   `Practice/Basic cin practice/even odd.cpp` — Taking a user's typed number and checking its mathematical parity.

### 🔀 Step 6: Control Flow & Decisions (Conditions)
I learned how to give my programs a "brain" so they could make independent decisions and execute different paths based on data values.
*   `Practice/conditions/if else.cpp` — Traditional relational true/false logic checking blocks.
*   `Practice/conditions/switch.cpp` — Building efficient command menus by instantly matching precise menu options.

### 🔄 Step 7: Automation & Efficiency (Loops)
Instead of copy-pasting lines, I learned how to use loop cycles to make code run hundreds of times automatically until a condition is met.
*   `Practice/loops/while.cpp` — Repeating processes cleanly while an evaluation statement is true.
*   `Practice/loops/do while.cpp` — Ensuring a block of code executes at least once before checking conditions.
*   `Practice/loops/for.cpp` — Running highly precise count-controlled iterations using strict loop parameters.

### 🏗️ Step 8: Advanced Structure (Modular Functions)
The final fundamental concept. I learned how to stop writing messy, long blocks of text by bundling logic into clean, reusable machines.
*   `Practice/functions/func.cpp` & `function.cpp` — Declaring and calling standalone helper functions.
*   `Practice/functions/argument func.cpp` — Safely passing variables across isolated local execution blocks.

## 🚗 The Ultimate Synthesis: Car Parking Management Project

Once I completed my initial standalone practice exercises, I initialized my first major central project[cite: 2]. This is my active laboratory application where I am weaving together separate concepts—variables, control flow branching, arithmetic operations, and console inputs—into a unified functional system[cite: 2, 3]. 

*   **Location:** `/Car_parking_project/index.cpp`[cite: 2]
*   **Current Status:** **Phase 1 Framework Completed!** The entire user experience, secure entrance gates, menu selection array, input sanitization blocks, and memory variable calculation networks are completely built out and active.

### 💻 Current Feature Architecture inside `index.cpp`

The application currently boots into an interactive, multi-layered command line menu loop that runs the following operational segments:

*   **Administrative Security Gate:** An automated login panel giving the user exactly 5 operational attempts to authenticate using protected matching criteria (`admin` / `admin123`)[cite: 3]. It uses low-level character reading (`getch()`) to securely mask the user's password entries with visual `'X'` placeholders[cite: 3].
*   **14-Point Terminal Menu Dashboard:** A dedicated helper function `manu()` that outputs a large console grid displaying options for vehicle check-ins, check-outs, statistical reviews, record modifications, and safe exits[cite: 3].
*   **Input Typos & Error Sanitization:** A robust safety validation sequence using stream control constraints (`while (!(cin >> u_input))`)[cite: 3]. If a user accidentally types a letter instead of a number, the stream uses `cin.clear()` and `cin.ignore()` to flush the broken input data and keep the app from crashing[cite: 3].
*   **Capacity Control & Conditional Pricing Logic:** Tracks real-time vehicle totals against maximum capacity limitations (e.g., limits parking areas strictly to 20 cars or 50 bicycles)[cite: 3]. It updates global counter statistics (`ccount`, `bycount`) and automatically manages monetary calculations (`amount`) based on hardcoded pricing rules[cite: 3].
*   **Live Data Modification System:** Provides administrative control panels allowing users to display all running statistics (Option 11), manually overwrite specific numbers to adjust records dynamically (Option 12), or clear all memory variables back to zero (Option 13)[cite: 3].

### 🚀 Future Integration Milestones (Moving Forward)

Right now, the application processes information completely inside temporary runtime memory variables[cite: 3]. While I have already included the placeholder `#include <fstream>` library at the top of the file, the data resets whenever the application closes[cite: 3]. 

As my summer progress advances through the holidays, my next big engineering milestone is linking this layout to real local file operations (`ifstream` and `ofstream`)[cite: 3]. This will allow the application to permanently write, save, and reload parking logs directly to a physical text file on the computer, creating a truly robust data storage engine[cite: 3]!
